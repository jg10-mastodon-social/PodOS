## pos-image

Fetches and shows an image. It supports images that are behind access control.

While loading it will show an animated skeleton and afterwords the successfully loaded image:

<Canvas
  withSource="open">
  <Story
    name="Display an image"
  >
    {({url}) => html`
      <pos-image
        src=${url}/>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

If the file is not found it will display a box with an error message:

<Canvas
  withSource="open">
  <Story
    name="Not Found"
  >
    {({notFoundUrl}) => html`
      <pos-image
        src=${notFoundUrl}/>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

If the file is behind access control, but the user is not authenticated it will show that:

<Canvas
  withSource="open">
  <Story
    name="Unauthenticated"
  >
    {({unauthenticatedUrl}) => html`
      <pos-image
        src=${unauthenticatedUrl}/>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

After authentication the image will load normally, if the user has the required access rights.
