# PodOS contributing guide

Contributions to PodOS are very welcome. To get started please open an [issue](https://github.com/pod-os/PodOS/issues) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/pod-os/PodOS/discussions) with the ideas you have.

All contributions eventually need to comply with our [Definition of Done](./docs/contributing/definition-of-done.md) to be considered done. But do not worry to much about it, you will get help with that where needed.

All contributions have to be made under the same [license](./LICENSE) as PodOS.
