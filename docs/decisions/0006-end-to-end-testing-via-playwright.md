# End-to-End testing via Playwright

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to test the features of PodOS browser end-to-end from a users perspective and with data from a real Solid server.
Currently, this is only done manually and is starting to become time-consuming.

## Considered Options

- Cypress
- Playwright

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "End-to-end testing via Playwright", because

- Playwright looks promising and existing
- Playwright supports testing in multiple browsers
- While experience with Cypress already exists, it was a chance to try something new
